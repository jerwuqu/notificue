### NOTE: Since my move from Windows, this project will no longer be maintained by me.

From my usage, it has had no problems at all dealing with regular notifications and I still use it in places where I'm forced to run Windows, but it can't handle the new Windows 10/UWP notifications at all. See a rant about this [here](https://github.com/JerwuQu/notificue/issues/2#issuecomment-459666510).

You're of course very welcome (please!) to fork this project, or rewrite it (as I had planned to) to also include basic support for the new Win10 notifications.

# notificue
A Notification System replacement for Windows 10 (64-bit only).

I got tired of the default notifications not really working well, so I made this.

## Generic instructions

Left-click the tray icon to bring up the log, or right-click it to quit: ![tray icon](https://i.imgur.com/uLSZQzM.png)

You can customize the appearance of the notifications in the config `notificue.ini`. Should be self-explanatory.
